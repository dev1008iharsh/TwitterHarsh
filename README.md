Note - I intentionally remove some parts of the project from every file in GitHub so that no one can misuse my project. If you want to watch my full project code, you can contact me using any social media platform. If you are a developer, you can understand what I removed.This is my one of the latest project for that you can find code according to iOS 17.

Users can create an account in this TwitterHarsh application using the email password authentication technique, which is managed by me in FirebaseAuthentication server. To use the app, users must first create an account and fill out their profile information.

After creating an account, users can explore the accounts, personal information, photographs, and tweets of other users.

The user can compose his own tweet, which will appear on the Home All Tweets page and be available to other users.

On Home, there are two options: one displays tweets from all users, while the other displays tweets from the user itself, and using the search tab, users can create tweets with popular hashtags.

The edit profile section allows the user to update a profile by changing the name, username, location, bio, birthday, cover image, and profile image. I also used a visually appealing photo picker that allows users to change photographs from a gallery. Users can use this functionality to take pictures, crop images, and apply fantastic filters to images to improve the appearance of the selected image.

Users can view other users' profiles and tweets by visiting the profile tab and selecting the tweet.

I attempt to emulate the UI design of the Twitter/X application. The project is developed for educational or skill-showcasing purposes. I will never submit this application to the app store.It also support different theming functionality such as dark mode light mode.

To store photos, manage users, handle tweets, and manage user authentication, I used Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database and Storage, and the Swift Combine framework.

Some functionality in this app, such as retweeting, commenting, following and replying to tweets, are still under development. I'm hoping to finish it as soon possible when I'll have leisure time in the future. ü§û
